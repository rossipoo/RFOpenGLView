This is a subclass of NSOpenGLView which uses a CVDisplayLink and ARC (automatic reference counting).

CVDisplayLink provides a more consistent timeDelta for animating with. For example, if you hit a breakpoint, or some other slowdown, this will not cause animations to overshoot.

This class can be use to set up an openGL view with minimal effort, it can be subclassed very easily.

The methods of most interest for subclassing are these:

- (CFTimeInterval)deltaTime;

This is the time between frames, and is useful for animating with.

- (void)animation;

By default this does nothing, but a subclass can override it to to any necessary manipulation of model data.

- (void)drawFrame;

This is where drawing is done, a properly locked context is provided in this method and openGL calls can be made right away. By default the glClear() is called with a changing color to verify that the view is properly set up. Also, it is not necessary to flush the context.
